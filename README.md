# Hull2d
Simple 2d convex hull creation and collision detection program

Originally built for windows but all code should be easily portable to other operating systems. The demo (src/main.c)
requires OpenGL but the other codes (src/stack.c and src/hull.c) are dependency free and should build easily anywhere.
